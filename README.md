### 🚀 About Me

I'm a software developer with a deep interest in solving real problems through clean, maintainable code. I specialize in full-stack development—whether it's building interactive frontends with React or architecting backend APIs in Node.js, Symfony, or ASP.NET Core. I also enjoy working on mobile apps using Android Studio with Java.

💡 One of the most exciting projects I worked on was delivering an entire e-commerce platform with admin capabilities in under 72 hours using Symfony. This experience taught me how to prioritize features, write scalable code under pressure, and most importantly—get things done.

I love turning ideas into digital products, and I'm constantly exploring new technologies to stay up-to-date and sharp.
